# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification Web App

A simple and elegant web application built using **Streamlit** that classifies iris flowers into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor**, and **Virginica**, using a trained machine learning model.

---

## 📌 Overview

This application predicts the **species** of an iris flower based on user inputs of petal and sepal dimensions. It provides quick predictions and visual insights using a trained classifier.
